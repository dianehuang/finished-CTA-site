I have a strong passion for the arts (food is an art too), and I found the perfect place to help express and encourage these passions amongst youth like me when I became a part of CTA this year. :D I look forward to help inspire more emerging artists this year, but more so getting inspired by the expanding CTA family.</p>

		<h2>Tania Kwan <small>Co-Chair</small></h2>
		<p class="bios">Hi! My name is Tania Kwan and I‚Äôm a Grade 12 IB student attending Bayview Secondary School. My interests include collecting Snapchat filters and imitating Linda from Bob‚Äôs Burger‚Äôs catchphrase: ‚ÄúAlriiiight!‚Äù I also have dreams of going to law school and becoming a successful lady lawyer in the heart of New York City. 

Many youths who are passionate about the arts often lack opportunities to express themselves, so I‚Äôm a part of CTA because I want to help change that. I strive to promote youth artistic expression and the importance of using art as a creative outlet. I‚Äôm super psyched for what‚Äôs to come this year!</p>

		<h2>Ethan Thompson</h2>
		<p class="bios mmm">Hey everyone! My name is Ethan, and I am a grade 12 student at Pierre Elliott Trudeau. I like to think that if I were a fruit, I would be a banana. At first glance, bananas seem tough and leathery, but when you peel them open, you find that they're actually soft and delectable. 

From day 1, I knew I wanted to be part of something great... it was my lifelong goal; I was a banana looking for his home tree. And, I'm glad to say that CTA IS my home tree - ripe with creativity! Can't wait to organize some amazing events, with some amazing people! I'm sure all of you will find it a-peeling as well!</p>

I enjoy cartooning, planning events, volunteering, and celebrating every holiday that has a festive mascot. This is my first year on CTA, and I have already learned and grown so much. Applying for this council, which incorporates art and fun into volunteering, was honestly one of the best decisions of my life.

After an amazing first year with CTA, I'm excited to work with the team again and make this year even more outstanding!

I've gotten two concussions in my life and the second one got me to stop responding with "mhm" and "hm?" and with actual words instead)))))))))))))</p>
